<h1 id="git">Git</h1>
<h2 id="some-git-commands">Some git commands</h2>
<p><code>git clone &lt;url&gt;</code></p>
<p>Builds a local git repository (in the current directory) that is a clone of the remote one identified by the url. All the commands below work as long as you are in or under a directory with .git in it. (Error otherwise.)</p>
<p>Git remembers where it cloned from, by creating a “remote” called “origin”. Try… <code>git remote</code></p>
<p><code>git status</code> This tells you whether anything has been changed by you in your local repository. Nothing to report yet.</p>
<p><code>git pull origin</code></p>
<p>This grabs the most up to date version from the remote “origin” and updates your files and the edit history. Good idea to do this first whenever working with the files, but no unundoable harm comes from editing old versions.</p>
<p><code>git diff</code> This reports the exact changes, all tracked files, line by line. If you want to discard the changes you use: <code>git checkout -- &lt;filename&gt; (or multiple &lt;filename&gt;s)</code></p>
<p>The changes are not just reverted; they are irretrievably lost. Try <code>git diff</code> and <code>git status</code> to confirm the reversion. If you add a new file <code>git status</code> will report the addition. But any changes to the new file will not be tracked unless/until you use: <code>git add &lt;filename&gt; (or multiple &lt;filename&gt;s)</code></p>
<p>If you decide that the current state of changes to a particular file(s) are likely to be worth keeping (i.e. you’ve spell-checked, you’ve tested the web-page, etc.), again use: <code>git add &lt;filename&gt; (or multiple &lt;filename&gt;s)</code> This takes a snapshot of the state of the file. <code>git diff</code> will go back to showing nothing, until you make additional changes. If you decide that all the current snapshots are worth preserving as a stage in the development of the project, use: <code>git commit -m 'I made some changes'</code></p>
<p>This will record all the changes since the <code>add</code>s - any changes that you made after <code>add</code>-ing will be retained but won’t be in that particular commit. You can <code>add</code> again when you are ready.</p>
<p><code>git log</code> gives a listing of all the previous commits in the history of the project. SPACE to page down, q to quit. These are all the stages that we can roll back to or examine.</p>
<h2 id="configure-ssh-git-for-push-to-remote-shared-server-hostgator">Configure ssh / git for push to remote shared server (Hostgator)</h2>
<p>Procedure given here is based on <a href="http://www.arlocarreon.com/blog/git/push-git-repo-into-shared-hosting-account-like-hostgator/">Arlo Carreon</a>’s instuctions. ### 1. Set up ssh access to remote server. Request ssh access via Hostgator cPanel. You should then be able to get remote access with <code>ssh user@cangjie.info -p 2222</code> substituting your user name. Hostgator uses port 2222 for ssh. This will lead to a password prompt. Logout to exit.</p>
<p>We want to bypass the password logon using a public key. To generate a key:<code>ssh-keygen</code>. The public key will be the contents of the text file <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. Copy the contents into the file <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the Hostgator server.</p>
<h3 id="configure-git-on-the-remote-server-to-accept-pushes-via-ssh.">2. Configure git on the remote server to accept pushes via ssh.</h3>
<p><code>ssh</code> into Hostgator. <code>cd</code> to the location of the git repository. Then run the command <code>git config receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore</code>. Then save the following lines in the text file <code>GIT_REPO_PATH/.git/hooks/post-receive</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# Save this in: PATH_TO_REPO/.git/hooks/post-receive
GIT_WORK_TREE=../ git checkout -f</code></pre>
<p>Make that file executable with <code>chmod +x PATH_TO_REPO/.git/hooks/post-receive</code>.</p>
<h3 id="configure-ssh-locally-to-automate-connection-to-hostgator.">3. Configure ssh locally to automate connection to Hostgator.</h3>
<p>In order to bypass the password logon, and use the public key set up in step 1., using port 2222, put the following lines into the text file <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Host cangjie.info
   Port 2222
   PreferredAuthentications publickey</code></pre>
<p>It is now possible to get ssh access to Hostgator with <code>ssh user@cangjie.info</code>.</p>
<h3 id="add-the-hostgator-server-as-a-git-remote-repository.">4. Add the Hostgator server as a git remote repository.</h3>
<p><code>cd</code> to the local git repository, and type</p>
<pre><code>git remote add web user@cangjie.info:public_html/ecdb</code></pre>
<p>Now, local changes to the ECDB web pages can be pushed to the live web-site using the simple command: <code>git push web</code>.</p>
